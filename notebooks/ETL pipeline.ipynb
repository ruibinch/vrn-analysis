    "### Finding car prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding car prices can be a straightforward or tiresome task, depending on a few factors:\n",
    "- Car make\n",
    "    - Most car brands have published pricelists\n",
    "    - But super high-end brands, e.g. *BENTLEY*, *FERRARI*, typically label all their car prices as \"POA\" (Price On Application)\n",
    "    - And there are some brands that I never knew existed and where an accurate price is almost impossible to find, e.g. *RUF*\n",
    "- Car age\n",
    "    - It's easy to find the price for a *MERCEDES BENZ / S400L*, but how can we find an accurate market price for a *MERCEDES BENZ / 300SL-24* that was last produced in 2001?\n",
    "- Car model rarity\n",
    "    - There exists a *B.M.W. / M5*, which is a high-performance BMW saloon\n",
    "    - There also exists a *B.M.W. / M5 30 JAHRE EDITION*, which is a special edition of the M5 built to commemorate the 30-year anniversary of the original BMW M5 release. Only 300 of such vehicles were produced - how can this collector's item be accurately quantified?\n",
    "- Car model variations\n",
    "    - The following models all exist:\n",
    "        - *MERCEDES BENZ / GLC250 4MATIC*\n",
    "        - *MERCEDES BENZ / GLC250 4MATIC COUPE*\n",
    "        - *MERCEDES BENZ / GLC250 AMG 4MATIC*\n",
    "        - *MERCEDES BENZ / GLC250 AMG 4MATIC COUPE*\n",
    "    - Sometimes, I just try to find the price for one of these models and then approximate the prices for the others using the found price as the baseline, e.g. add \\\\$10k for AMG, add $20k for coupe, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, some car models are likely to be an older model despite sharing the same model name, e.g. *MERCEDES BENZ / C180 KOMP*, *MERCEDES BENZ / C180 CGI*. However, for simplicity's sake, the model years are all ignored and all of the variations are assigned the current price of the latest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor is COE - some of the prices include a COE package, while others exclude it. For simplicity's sake as well, all of those are disregarded. It is too much of a pain to sieve through the fine print on each pricelist...\n",
    "\n",
    "**These are the 2 main resources that I had used to find the car prices:**\n",
    "- [sgCarMart](https://www.sgcarmart.com/new_cars/newcars_pricelist_listing.php)\n",
    "- [OneShift](https://www.oneshift.com/new_cars/car-price-singapore)\n",
    "\n",
    "When all else fails, typing \"*{car model name} price singapore*\" into Google Search sometimes works pretty well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the GSheet document is taken as the SSoT, **all prices found should be updated in GSheets directly**.\n",
    "\n",
